# Airbnb Policy Violations and Spatial Analysis in London 🏙️  

## Overview  
This project investigates **Airbnb policy violations** in London, focusing on the **90-day rule** and its spatial and socioeconomic impacts. Using data from **InsideAirbnb**, we applied advanced spatial analysis techniques to explore the drivers of violations and identify high-risk areas.  

This work is part of the **Foundations of Spatial Data Science** course at UCL CASA and showcases our ability to combine spatial data science methods with real-world policy challenges.  

## Key Features  
- **Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)**: Used Moran's I and LISA cluster maps to identify hotspots of rule violations.  
- **Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)**: Explored spatially varying relationships between Airbnb activity and socioeconomic factors.  
- **Visualization**: Created heatmaps, bar charts, and spatial maps to highlight trends and patterns.  
- **Policy Insights**: Provided evidence-based recommendations for improving enforcement of short-term let regulations.
