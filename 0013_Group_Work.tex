\subsubsection{The 90-Day Rule and Airbnb
Commercialization}\label{the-90-day-rule-and-airbnb-commercialization}

Airbnb has significantly impacted London's housing market by reducing
long-term housing availability, increasing rents, and driving
commercialization. In response, London implemented the 90-day rule,
restricting entire-home short-term rentals to 90 days annually unless
planning permission is obtained (Greater London Authority, 2023).
However, enforcement relies on self-reporting, making violations
difficult to monitor. This analysis uses InsideAirbnb data to examine
spatial patterns, booking behavior, host characteristics, and property
types to assess Airbnb's commercialization and compliance risks.

\includegraphics{0013_Group_Work_files/figure-pdf/cell-7-output-1.pdf}

\subsubsection{Key Findings}\label{key-findings}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Central London is a Compliance Hotspot}:\\
  Central London has the highest concentration of short-term rentals,
  especially entire homes in high-demand areas, making it a key area for
  potential violations of the 90-day rule (Figure 1, Map).
\item
  \textbf{Frequent Breaches of the 90-Day Limit}:\\
  Booking data, based on reviews, pricing, and minimum nights
  (InsideAirbnb, 2023), shows that entire homes and hotel-like
  properties often exceed the 90-day limit. This poses significant
  challenges for enforcement, particularly in highly commercialized
  areas (Figure 1, Panel 1).
\end{enumerate}

To address the limitations of using only snapshot data, we merged
datasets from December 2023 to September 2024 and removed duplicates to
ensure greater accuracy：

\includegraphics{0013_Group_Work_files/figure-pdf/cell-9-output-1.pdf}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  \textbf{Multi-Listing Hosts Dominate the Market}:\\
  Multi-listing hosts account for 62.38\% of all Airbnb listings and
  have longer average booking durations (75.17 days) than single-listing
  hosts (66.61 days). They mainly manage entire homes and hotel-like
  properties, which are more commercialized with higher prices and
  shorter stays (Figure 2, Top Left and heatmap).
\item
  \textbf{Entire Homes are the Highest Risk}:\\
  Entire homes dominate the market (66.97\%) and have the longest
  booking durations (78.38 days), making them most likely to break the
  90-day limit. Hotel-like properties, while smaller in volume, show
  similar risks due to their short minimum stays (2.13 nights) and high
  commercial focus (Figure 2, Top Right and heatmap).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Summary and Next Steps}\label{summary-and-next-steps}

\textbf{Spatial Insights}: Central London displays a high intensity of
short-term rentals and frequent entire-home use, making it a key hotspot
for potential 90-day rule violations. Further investigation is needed to
establish enforcement priorities and evaluate the impact of short-term
rentals on local housing.

\textbf{Policy Violation Factors}: Multi-listing hosts and
commercialized property types, such as entire homes and hotel-like
properties, are strongly linked to increased booking durations and
greater non-compliance risks. Factors like rental type, pricing, and
location require further analysis---such as regression models---to
better target enforcement and guide regulatory measures.

InsideAirbnb data highlights London's Airbnb market as highly
commercialized and dominated by multi-listing hosts, with entire-home
rentals posing significant risks of non-compliance with the 90-day rule.
Effective enforcement is crucial to address these challenges.

( 45 points; Answer due \textbf{?var:assess.group-date} )

To provide evidence on violation hotspots, community impacts, and the
drivers of policy violations, the next steps are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Identifying Violation Hotspots and Impacts:}\\
  Spatial clustering will identify areas with high concentrations of
  90-day rule violations. These hotspots will be analyzed for impacts on
  local communities, focusing on rising rents, reduced housing
  availability, and displacement of long-term residents---issues tied to
  Airbnb-driven gentrification (Smith and Doe, 2006).
\item
  \textbf{Analyzing Drivers of Violations:}\\
  Regression analysis helps identify key factors driving these
  violations (e.g.~property type, host behavior, pricie and
  location\ldots)
\end{enumerate}

This approach will highlight the need for effective regulation, clarify
enforcement priorities, and enhance the focus and efficiency of
enforcement efforts.

\subsubsection{Figure 1: Results of Moran and LISA analysis of rule
breaking Airbnbs, monthly rent and vacancy
ratio}\label{figure-1-results-of-moran-and-lisa-analysis-of-rule-breaking-airbnbs-monthly-rent-and-vacancy-ratio}

\includegraphics{plots/combined_of_Moran_and_LISA.png}

\paragraph{Moran test result}\label{moran-test-result}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Rule-breaking Airbnbs exhibit significant spatial clustering (positive
  spatial autocorrelation), meaning these properties are not randomly
  distributed but are concentrated in specific areas, primarily in
  central and eastern London.
\item
  The scatter plots further show a positive relationship between
  rule-breaking Airbnbs and both monthly rents and vacancy ratios,
  suggesting that areas with higher Airbnb violations also face
  increased rents and vacancies.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{LISA test result}\label{lisa-test-result}

The LISA cluster maps highlight ``hotspots'' where rule-breaking Airbnbs
are spatially significant: 1. Rule-breaking Airbnbs: Central London
(e.g., Westminster) and parts of eastern London show significant
clustering (brown regions). 2. Monthly Rent: High Airbnb violations
coincide with high rent clusters (High-High), reinforcing the pressure
on housing affordability. 3. Vacancy Rates: Similar High-High clusters
are observed in eastern London, suggesting a correlation between high
Airbnb violations and increased vacancy rates in certain neighborhoods.
Conversely, areas with Low-Low clusters (e.g., northern and southwestern
boroughs) indicate regions with lower Airbnb activity and minimal impact
on rents or vacancies.

\subsubsection{Figure 2: Results of SAR and GWR Analysis of the Effect
of Rule-Breaking Airbnbs on Monthly Rent and Vacancy
Ratio}\label{figure-2-results-of-sar-and-gwr-analysis-of-the-effect-of-rule-breaking-airbnbs-on-monthly-rent-and-vacancy-ratio}

\includegraphics{plots/Results_of_SAR_and_GWR_model.png}

\subsubsection{SAR model result}\label{sar-model-result}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The residuals map indicates that the model captures most spatial
  variations but leaves some unexplained patterns, especially in central
  boroughs.
\item
  Effect on Rent: Boroughs with high Airbnb violations (e.g., central
  and inner eastern areas) show a strong positive effect on monthly
  rents, confirming that Airbnb activity drives up rental prices.
\item
  Effect on Vacancy: Significant positive impacts are observed in
  specific eastern and southern areas, where Airbnb violations correlate
  with higher housing vacancy rates.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{GWR model result}\label{gwr-model-result}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The spatial variability captured by GWR confirms that the relationship
  between Airbnb violations, rents, and vacancies is non-stationary. In
  central London, the effect on rents is pronounced, while in eastern
  boroughs, the effect on vacancy rates is stronger.
\item
  This spatial heterogeneity indicates that Airbnb's impact is
  location-dependent, with the most severe effects concentrated in areas
  of high demand.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

These patterns underscore Airbnb's role in gentrification, a process
where local residents---especially lower-income households---are
displaced due to rising living costs Jain et al.~(2021). As short-term
rentals become more profitable, landlords are incentivized to convert
long-term housing into Airbnbs, reducing housing availability for local
tenants and driving up competition for remaining rental units Bosma and
van Doorn (2024) . The impacts are particularly severe in central
neighborhoods like Westminster and spreading into eastern boroughs,
where vacancy rates increase, further destabilizing communities.

Gentrification does not only lead to physical displacement but also
causes cultural displacement, as long-standing communities lose
affordable housing and essential social ties. Local businesses catering
to residents may also suffer as short-term tourism replaces
neighborhood-oriented consumption patterns.

In essence, Airbnb rule-breaking accelerates the gentrification process
by prioritizing tourism-driven economic gains over the housing needs of
local communities, exacerbating social inequalities.
